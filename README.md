# Web-APIs_Code-Quiz

This is my first attempt at a timed quiz using HTML and JavaScript.

I created this quiz to showcase my ability to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions, that is run in the browser, and that features dynamially updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

During this assignment, I learned how difficult it is to setup JavaScript arrays with questions and answers, have them progress as each answer is submitted until finally reaching a "High Score" page, have my code add total points for correct answers to a "High Score" section or subtract time from my quiz timer, and have my two files interact with one another, and save scores in a user's local storage on their browser. Ultimately, I was unable to build a dynamic web page beyond a countdown timer.
